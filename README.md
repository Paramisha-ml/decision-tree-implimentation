##To begin this task, I started by revising the basic concepts of Decision Trees and Python programming using my college notes. I wanted to make sure I had a clear understanding of how decision trees work and how they can be implemented using Python. To strengthen my understanding further, I referred to online resources like W3Schools.com and also used ChatGPT to explain the logic behind decision trees in simpler terms. These platforms helped me understand that decision trees are used to make predictions or decisions by splitting the data into branches based on certain conditions or features, Once I was comfortable with the theory, I decided to build my own small dataset to apply what I had learned. I created a dataset in Excel with simple features related to job hiring. The dataset included one main feature — experience — and the target label was whether the person would be hired or not. The goal was to predict the output (hired: Yes/No or True/False) based on the input feature. I uploaded this Excel file to Google Colab, which provided an easy and efficient environment to write and run my Python code,I started coding by importing necessary Python libraries like pandas, sklearn.tree, and matplotlib for data handling, building the decision tree, and visualization. I read the dataset using pandas.read_excel() and trained a decision tree model using the DecisionTreeClassifier from the sklearn library. After training the model, I tested it with some sample inputs to predict whether a candidate would be hired or not based on their experience. The output was a binary classification – either True (hired) or False (not hired).This simple example shows how decision trees can be used to make decisions based on input features. In my case, I used only one feature (experience), but in real-world scenarios, decision trees can handle multiple features such as age, education level, skills, etc.The concept of decision trees is widely used in many practical fields. Some of the most common applications include:
Medical Diagnosis – predicting diseases based on symptoms and medical history,Loan Approval – deciding whether a loan application should be approved based on income, credit score, and employment,Academic Performance Prediction – forecasting student success based on attendance, grades, and participation, Marketing – targeting the right audience based on behavior, interests, and demographics, Fraud Detection – identifying unusual patterns in financial transactions.
